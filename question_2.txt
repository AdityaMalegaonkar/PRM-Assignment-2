Q) Describe any project what you have done in Edyoda?
Ans -> I have created some good projects in Edyoda and it also helped me in learning so many things and how to tackle problems in programming.
One of my recent project is of creating a program of a quiz game. In this program a list of different topics of quiz appears and the user has to
enter the number of the quiz he/she wants to attemnpt. After entering the number the question along with the options appears one by one and the user
has to enter his/her answer. There are 10 questions in total each containing 10 marks. After completing the quiz the score is shown along with 
all the correct answers and also user's answer, and if the score is less than 70% then it shows "failed" else "Congratulations, Passed".
